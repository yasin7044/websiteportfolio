          Important note concerning data processing in connection with Google
          Analytics
        </h3>

        <p>
          This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided
          by Google Ireland Limited. If the responsible body for the data
          processing that occurs via this website has their basis outside of the
          European Economic area and Switzerland, then the associated Google
          Analytics data processing is carried out by Google LLC. Google Ireland
          Limited and Google LLC. will hereinafter be referred to as “Google”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files saved on the
          site visitor’s computer, to help the website analyze their use of the
          site. The information generated by the cookie (including the truncated
          IP address) about the use of the website will normally be transmitted
          to and stored by Google.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google Analytics is used exclusively with the extension "_anonymizeIp
          ()" on this website. This extension ensures an anonymization of the IP
          address by truncation and excludes a direct personal reference. Via
          this extension Google truncates the site visitor’s IP address within
          member states of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement
          on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional situations will the
          site visitor’s full IP address be transmitted to Google servers in the
          United States and truncated there. The IP address, that is provided by
          the site visitor’s browser in using Google Analytics will not be
          merged by Google with other data from Google.
        </p>
        <p>
          On behalf of the site operator, Google will use the information
          collected to evaluate the use of the website, to compile reports on
          website activity and to provide other website and internet related
          services to the site operator (Art. 6 (1)( f) GDPR). The legitimate
          interest in data processing lies in the optimization of this website,
          the analysis of the use of the website and the adaptation of the
          content. The interests of the users are adequately protected by the
          pseudonymization of their data.
        </p>
        <p class="has-links">
          Google LLC. has certified their compliance with the EU-U.S.

          Framework and on that basis they provides a guarantee to comply with
          European data protection law. The data sent and linked to the Google
          Analytics cookies, e.g. user IDs or advertising IDs will be
          automatically deleted after 50 months. The deletion of data whose
          retention period has been reached is done automatically once a month.

          We use the reCAPTCHA service provided by Google Inc. (Google) to
          protect your submissions via internet submission forms on this site.
          This plugin checks if you are a person in order to prevent certain
          website functions from being (ab)used by spam bots (particularly
          comments). This plugin query includes the sending of the IP address
          and possibly other data required by Google for the Google reCAPTCHA
          service. For this purpose your input will be communicated to and used
          by Google. However, your IP address is previously truncated by Google
          within member states of the European Union or in other states which
          are party to the agreement on the European Economic Area and is, as
          such, anonymized. Only in exceptional cases is a full IP address
          transmitted to a Google server in the United States and truncated
          there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this
          information to evaluate your use of this service. The IP address
          provided by reCaptcha from your browser shall not be merged with any
          other data from Google.
          <br />
          This data collection is subject to the data protection regulations of
          Google (Google Inc.). For more information about Google's privacy
