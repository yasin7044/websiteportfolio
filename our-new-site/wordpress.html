        WordPress is one of the most popular content management systems or CMS
        available free on the internet. Based on PHP & MySQL, this CMS currently
        powers around one-third of all the web sites, and it is especially
        popular because of its user-friendly features and technologies â€“ all of
        which are so easy to manage! It is probably these key features that have
        made WordPress one of the strongest, versatile, and most successful CMSs
        since its release on May 27, 2003.
      </p>
      <h2>Advantages Of Using Wordpress</h2>
      <p>
        Now, the good question is, why would you opt for making a website
        through WordPress? The reasons are many, and each one supervenes upon
        the other. The foremost reason is that, itâ€™s not only Free, but also
        highly secure; and to make sure it continues to be, WordPress keeps
        updating itself to keep hackers and viruses at bay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, the very framework of the entire system is extremely
        search-engine-friendly and makes it easy for top search engines like
        Google, Yahoo, Bing to crawl at ease, thus making the chances of your
        site to rank in the first page of these search sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be it a secure online payment method or a virtual mailing system, WP can
        integrate it all implementing a few of its highly powerful platforms to
        support your business through that extra boost. MailChimp or Aweber for
        mailing systems, Shopp or WooCommerce for eCommerce solutions, and Payza
        or 2Checkout for online payments are only to name a few of the many,
        many available options!
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, being a popular and much-demanded CMS, WordPress is highly
        flexible. Whether you are up for an eCommerce site or a blog page, it
        wouldnâ€™t fail to work with the same versatility everywhere. Apart from
        that, its plugin or addon architecture enables you to add specific
        features so that you can easily build your website according to your own
        customized way, whereas its template system makes it much easier for
        designers and developers to publish a site by automatically generating
        custom web pages like search results, results of a game, calculating
        horoscopes, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, WP supports all types of multimedia files, including those of
        images, videos, audios, and can make your site even more interactive and
        attractive unlike many other CMS that often fail to support some file
        formats, leading to broken images or videos after the site is published,
        and eventually making the site annoying to visitors. Plus, the entire
        framework is mobile-friendly, which is one of the most important
        features in the present-day world since the present generation of web
        users is mobile-savvy, and the maximum hits/traffic in a website mostly
        comes through smartphones and tablets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another plus point of the CMS is that, apart from being user-friendly,
        it is also an open source, and you wouldnâ€™t need to hire experts â€“
        neither developers, nor designers â€“ to publish or maintain your web
        pages, and can do it pretty much yourself. Wonder, how much money you
        can thus save, still keeping your site up-to-date.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, you can easily schedule your future posts and get them
        published to keep your site running, while you are still out holidaying,
        or have come to know that you get the maximum traffic from the other
        part of the world during the late hours at your end. Not just that, you
        can also choose multiple managers â€“ including Super Admins,
        Administrators, Editors, Authors, Contributors, and so on â€“ to whom you
        can give access to work for you at your absence!
      </p>
      <p>
        WP is getting better and better each day, and there are still so many
        features that we probably couldnâ€™t discuss at one go, or just skipped
        out, and for which, you need to experience it by being a part of this
        amazing content management system, yourself.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
      <h2>Ecommerce In Wordpress</h2>
      <p>
        If you are up for building your own online store, then eCommerce plugin
        is what you are looking for in WP. However, choosing the most suitable
        plugin is what the priority is, since itâ€™s only the right one that can
        promote your site, enhance your e-business, and bring in $$$ in a
        bigger, better way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, the thing is, with so many e-commerce plugins being available, it
        feels quite confusing when it comes to choosing the correct one, based
        on your type of business. There are several factors to keep in mind
        since some plugins are well-suited for those willing to ship and sell
        physical items like books, furniture, or cosmetics, while the others for
        those doing business with nontangible items like ebooks, movies, and so
        on.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, you must also consider important factors like
        accepting payments through secure gateways, what support system the
        plugin is offering in case of any help you need, what is the best
        WordPress hosting for you depending on your budget (e.g., if you are on
        a limited budget, you might want to opt for hosts like Bluehost,
        whereas, if budget is not an issue for you, you can go for hosts like
        WPEngine for best performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, once you decide a domain name for your site, you are done with
        it all! FYI: a few of the best, latest and most popular WordPress
        eCommerce plugins right at the moment are undoubtedly the plugins like
        WooCommerce, EasyDigitalDownloads, Shopify, MemberPress, and Shopp.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
      <h2>Misconceptions For Wordpress</h2>
      <p>
        There have been several common myths and misconceptions surrounding this
        versatile content management system especially because of
        misinformation, which leads to further confusions among users and
        eventually choosing the wrong platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, many people have the notion that WP is only a blogging tool
        or do not support important sites like those of eCommerce, etc. However,
        the fact is just the opposite. It is an extremely powerful website
        builder including corporate and eCommerce sites, online stores,
        eMagazines, and so on, and has extensively been used in building school
        and university websites, government sites, and innumerable Fortune 500
        companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, many people presume that WP is not much secure, or its future is
        not certain, especially because it is free, and an open-source software.
        However, as discussed earlier, there are hundreds of thousands of small
        to large companies that have their sites built using this software,
        which, in turn, was powered by a community of professional developers as
        a protected trademark of the WordPress Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, another notion arising therefrom that, WP offers very limited
        support, in the long run, is also a myth. There are not just thousands
        of WP communities across the WWW, but also tutorials, guides, the
        WPBeginner Blog, WP Dictionary, Videos, the WP Blueprint for tools,
        plugins, and servicesâ€¦ and the list is really long!
